      <h2>A little about me!</h2>
      <p> Hello world! My name is Zuri Alexander. I'm 16 and i'm going to be a junior next year. I was born in Virginia (but don't tell anyone) and I grew up in Palo Alto, California and Washington DC. I was homeschooled until the 4th grade. This was the start of my tragic school experience. I went to family friendly quaker school until middle school rolled around and my mom and i were too tired off the long comute. For four years I went to a private school in DC. Eventually I gave on up on school in the US and decided to depart to a school in France so that I could do the IB program. </p>
