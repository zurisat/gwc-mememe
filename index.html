          Hello, world! My name is Zuri Alexander. I'm 16, and I'm going to be a
          junior next year. I was born in Virginia (but don't tell anyone), and
          I grew up in Palo Alto, California, and Washington, DC. I was
          homeschooled until the 4th grade. For six years, I bounced around
          schools in Maryland and DC. Eventually, I gave on up on school in the
          US and decided to pack my bag and head to a French boarding school in
          a small town in Normandy. It is there I have stayed until COVID 19.
          Enough about school... When I am not singlehandedly performing every
          role possible in musicals for my mom in our living room, I'm am
          probably out in the woods or on a lake, playing volleyball, reading a
          book, writing confusing poetry, or enjoying the company of my friends
          and family. I used to play piano and do ballet, but I quit in 8th
          grade and have immensely regretted it since. My secret passion/guilty
          pleasure is visual arts, but I'm really not that great at it... I love
          to paint and sculpt and make pots and sing (all things which are not
          my specialty). The only thing preventing people from completely
          scowling at my masterpieces is seeing that I only do it for myself. I
          try to live my life in experiences. Some so many people just live to
          tell stories and impress. I, on the other hand, value those at the
          moment act. I'm not saying that that's not problematic, but it is just
          how I flow... Love of love, y'all. Toodles :)
